corrmat-noqhs files are correlation matrices for systems without quasiholes. If there are quasiholes in the system, the file begins with "corrmat" only.

lx=20, 22 or 24 denotes the cylinder circumference.

m=1 means that m in the filling fraction nu=k/(km+2) equals 1. For our system, k=3. 

Ne=... is the number of electrons in the system.

qhtype denotes the type of quasihole. These are as follows:

    1_2_0 is the sigma_1 quasihole

    2_-2_0 is the sigma_2 quasihole

    2_4_0 is the psi_1 quasihole

    3_0_0 is the Laughlin quasihole

    3_0_2 is the epsilon quasihole 
    
    4_-4_0 is the psi_2 quasihole

cutoff=... denotes the value of the cutoff P_max used.
