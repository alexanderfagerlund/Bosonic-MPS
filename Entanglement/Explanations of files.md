E_0-epsilon.nb, E_0-sigma1.nb and E_0-id.nb: data for estimates of gamma in the epsilon, sigma_1 and identity sectors, where the identity sector has no charge on the boundary. All are obtained from the lowest-lying entanglement level xi_0. 

E_0_vs_L-Pmax.nb: xi_0 as a function of circumference L and cutoff P_max, for the identity sector.  

S_id.nb: von Neumann entropy S for the identity sector. 

S-vs-L-Pmax-data.nb: von Neumann entropy S as a function of circumference L and cutoff P_max, for the identity sector.
