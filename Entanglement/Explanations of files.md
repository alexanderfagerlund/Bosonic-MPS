E_0-epsilon.nb, E_0-sigma1.nb and E_0-id.nb: data for estimates of gamma in the epsilon, sigma_1 and identity sectors, where the identity sector has no charge on the boundary. All are obtained from the lowest-lying entanglement level xi_0. 

E_0_vs_L-Pmax.nb: xi_0 as a function of circumference L and cutoff P_max, for the identity sector.  

S_id.nb: von Neumann entropy S for the identity sector. 

S-vs-L-Pmax-data.nb: von Neumann entropy S as a function of circumference L and cutoff P_max, for the identity sector.  

entanglement-data-noqhs-lx=20-m=1-Ne=120-Na=99-bc=0_0_0-cutoff=12.wl: entanglement spectrum data for a system without quasiholes, with L=20, Ne=120 electrons (60 in each subsystem), and 99 orbitals per subsystem. The cutoff P_max=12.

entanglement-data-noqhs-lx=20-m=1-Ne=120-Na=99-bc=3_0_2-cutoff=12.wl: as above, except with a boundary charge corresponding to an epsilon anyon.
