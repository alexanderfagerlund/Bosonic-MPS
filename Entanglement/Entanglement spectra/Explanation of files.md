File name conventions: lx is the circumference L. Ne is the total number of electrons. bc=0_0_0 and 3_0_2 correspond to a chargeless boundary and the charge of an epsilon anyon on the boundary, respectively.  

File format: the first number is the total entanglement entropy. The subsequent element is a list of numbers of electrons in subsystem A. This is followed by a list of lists, one for each number of electrons in subsystem A. Each of those lists has elements which are pairs of the form "{unnormalized angular momentum of subsystem A (which are later normalized), a corresponding xi value}".
