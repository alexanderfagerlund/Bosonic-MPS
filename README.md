The correlation matrix folder contains correlation matrices used to compute density profiles, which in turn can be used to compute charges and spins. The entanglement folder contains data for the entanglement spectra, the von Neumann entropy S, and the lowest-lying level of the entanglement spectrum xi_0. It also contains data for estimates of gamma based on S and xi_0.
